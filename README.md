Password Strength Checker with Feedback Loop

This Python program evaluates the strength of a given password and provides real-time feedback. It checks the password against various strength criteria and allows users to retry until they create a strong password. The program also reinforces the understanding of fundamental data types like int, float, bool, string, and list.

Features
	•	Checks password strength using multiple criteria (length, character types, etc.).
	•	Provides feedback for each password attempt to help users improve their password.
	•	Allows users to retry entering a stronger password until it is deemed “strong”.
	•	Reinforces understanding of data types by using different types like int, float, bool, string, and list.

How It Works
	1.	The program prompts the user to input a password.
	2.	It checks the strength of the password against the following criteria:
	•	Length of the password.
	•	Presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
	3.	If the password is not strong enough, the program provides feedback and asks the user to try again.
	4.	The password is considered strong when it meets the specified criteria.

Usage
	1.	Clone or download the repository.
	2.	Run the program using Python 3.
  3.	The program will prompt you to enter a password.
	4.	Based on the password entered, feedback will be provided, and you can keep retrying until you meet the strength criteria.
